# Cloud Computing

# What is Cloud Computing?

Delivery of on-demand computing resources (apps, data centers, etc) over teh internet on a pay for use basis

NIST defines it as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

# Example of computing resources include:

- Networks
- Servers
- Storage
- Applications
- Services

# Cloud Model - 5 essential characteristics

1 - on demand self service  
 You get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider

2 – broad network access
Cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops and workstations

3 - resource pooling
What gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient

Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; resources dynamically assigned based on demand

4 - rapid elasticity
Can access more resources when you need them and scale back when you don’t

5 - measured service
Only pay for way you use or reserve as you go
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization

# CaaS - Cloud Computing as a service

Scaling up, scaling back and paying for what you use; has changed the way the world consumes computing services

# 3 deployment models of cloud computing

1 - public - leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies

2 - Private - the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It could be run on- premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.

3 - hybrid - mix of both public and private clouds mixing together seamlessly

# 3 service models - 3 layers in a computing stack

1 - infrastructure as a service or IaaS - you get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the need to manage or operate them

2- platform as a service - PaaS - you get access to the platform, that is the hardware and software tools usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the internet

3 - applications or software as a service SaaS - software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as on-demand software

# History and Evolution of Cloud Computing

1950s when large scale mainframes became available

Multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power from any terminal
1970 - and OS system called Virtual Machine made it possible for mainframes to have multiple virtual system or virtual machines on a single physical hardware - behaved as if they had their own CPU, memory, hard drives even though they were shared resources

This evolved the 1950s application of shared access of a mainframe by allowing multiple distinct compute environments to exist on the same physical hardware

So for example, if a company needed ‘x’ number of physical systems to run their applications, they could take on physical node and split it into multiple virtual systems;

Hypervisor is what enabled this; a hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources

# Cloud computing was born - key drivers behind cloud computing

Switch from CapEx to OpEx - CapEx is capital expense (high up front costs)
Operating expense (no or low up front costs) pay as you go;

# Key Considerations for Cloud Computing

# Key drivers for moving to cloud are agility, flexibility, and competitiveness

1 - considerations
Infrastructure and workloads
The cost of building and operating data centers can be astronomical
Low initial costs and pay as you attributes of cloud computing can add up to significant cost savings

2 - SaaS and development platforms - leasing or buying?
Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is more viable option than purchasing off the shelf software and subsequently investing inupgrades

3 - speed and productivity - consider what it means for them to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple of weeks, or months on traditional platforms

The person-hour cost efficiencies increases from using cloud dashboards, real-time stas, and active analytics

4 - risk exposure - the impact of making a wrong decision; is it safer for an organization to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test and release the code if they’re uncertain about adoption?

Is it better to try something new, paying as you go…rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

# Benefits of cloud adoption

- Flexibility
  Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs; scales on demand to support fluctuating workflows
- Customize applications -
  Access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection-

# Cloud Service Models

# IaaS - infrastructure as a service

- a form of cloud computing that delivers

* compute
* network
* storage

to consumers on a pay as you go, on demand, over the internet basis.

- the cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer

# IaaS Cloud environment

customers can:

- create or provision virtual machines (VMs) in their choice of region or zone

- VMs come pre-installed with the customers choice of operating system

- customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on the VMs

- can also create storage for their workloads and backups

- can often track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery

# Key Componenets of Cloud Infrastructure

A - Physical data centers
manage large data centers that contain the physical machines;

end users do no interact directly with the physical infrastructure but experience it as a service provided to them

B - Compute
IaaS providers manage the hypervisors

end-users programatically provision virtual instances with desired amounts of compute, memory, and storage resources

cloud compute typically comes with supporting services like auto scaling and load balancing that provide scalability and high performance

C - Network
users get access to networking resources on the cloud through virtualization or programatically, through APIs

D - Storage
3 types of cloud data storage: object, file, and block storage

object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient

# IaaS Use Cases

- enable their teams to set up test and development environments faster

- IaaS makes applications and data accessible as usual during a disaster or outage

- using cloud infrastructure for faster deployments and scaling infrastructure up and down as demand fluctuates

- high performance computing to solve complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations

- big data analysis
  Patterns, trends, and associations requires a huge amount of processing power

  cloud Infrastructure provides the required high-performance computing and also makes it economically viable

# PaaS - platform as a service

- a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a 3rd party

the PaaS providers host and manage everything at their data centers including:

- servers
- networks
- storage
- operating system
- application runtimes
- APIs
- middleware
- databases

* The provider also takes care of the installation, configuration, and operator of the application infrastructure, leaving the user only responsible for the application code and maintenance

* paid for on a usage basis and resources are purchased on-demand

with Iaas, the cloud provider offers access to 'raw' computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking
