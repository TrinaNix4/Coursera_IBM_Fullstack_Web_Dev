# Cloud Computing

# What is Cloud Computing?

Delivery of on-demand computing resources (apps, data centers, etc) over teh internet on a pay for use basis

NIST defines it as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

# Example of computing resources include:

- Networks
- Servers
- Storage
- Applications
- Services

# Cloud Model - 5 essential characteristics

1 - on demand self service  
 You get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider

2 – broad network access
Cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops and workstations

3 - resource pooling
What gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient

Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; resources dynamically assigned based on demand

4 - rapid elasticity
Can access more resources when you need them and scale back when you don’t

5 - measured service
Only pay for way you use or reserve as you go
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization

# CaaS - Cloud Computing as a service

Scaling up, scaling back and paying for what you use; has changed the way the world consumes computing services

# 3 deployment models of cloud computing

1 - public - leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies

2 - Private - the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It could be run on- premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.

3 - hybrid - mix of both public and private clouds mixing together seamlessly

# 3 service models - 3 layers in a computing stack

1 - infrastructure as a service or IaaS - you get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the need to manage or operate them

2- platform as a service - PaaS - you get access to the platform, that is the hardware and software tools usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the internet

3 - applications or software as a service SaaS - software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as on-demand software

# History and Evolution of Cloud Computing

1950s when large scale mainframes became available

Multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power from any terminal
1970 - and OS system called Virtual Machine made it possible for mainframes to have multiple virtual system or virtual machines on a single physical hardware - behaved as if they had their own CPU, memory, hard drives even though they were shared resources

This evolved the 1950s application of shared access of a mainframe by allowing multiple distinct compute environments to exist on the same physical hardware

So for example, if a company needed ‘x’ number of physical systems to run their applications, they could take on physical node and split it into multiple virtual systems;

Hypervisor is what enabled this; a hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources

# Cloud computing was born - key drivers behind cloud computing

Switch from CapEx to OpEx - CapEx is capital expense (high up front costs)
Operating expense (no or low up front costs) pay as you go;

# Key Considerations for Cloud Computing

# Key drivers for moving to cloud are agility, flexibility, and competitiveness

1 - considerations
Infrastructure and workloads
The cost of building and operating data centers can be astronomical
Low initial costs and pay as you attributes of cloud computing can add up to significant cost savings

2 - SaaS and development platforms - leasing or buying?
Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is more viable option than purchasing off the shelf software and subsequently investing inupgrades

3 - speed and productivity - consider what it means for them to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple of weeks, or months on traditional platforms

The person-hour cost efficiencies increases from using cloud dashboards, real-time stas, and active analytics

4 - risk exposure - the impact of making a wrong decision; is it safer for an organization to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test and release the code if they’re uncertain about adoption?

Is it better to try something new, paying as you go…rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

# Benefits of cloud adoption

- Flexibility
  Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs; scales on demand to support fluctuating workflows
- Customize applications -
  Access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection-
- To help keep data secure:
  Virtual private clouds
  Encryption
  API keys
  Efficiency

Enterprise users can get applications to market without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or its maintenance

Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from any internet-connected device

Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups

# Challenges of cloud adoption

# Cloud Service Models

# IaaS - infrastructure as a service

- a form of cloud computing that delivers

* compute
* network
* storage

to consumers on a pay as you go, on demand, over the internet basis.

- the cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer

# IaaS Cloud environment

customers can:

- create or provision virtual machines (VMs) in their choice of region or zone

- VMs come pre-installed with the customers choice of operating system

- customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on the VMs

- can also create storage for their workloads and backups

- can often track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery

# Key Componenets of Cloud Infrastructure

A - Physical data centers
manage large data centers that contain the physical machines;

end users do no interact directly with the physical infrastructure but experience it as a service provided to them

B - Compute
IaaS providers manage the hypervisors

end-users programatically provision virtual instances with desired amounts of compute, memory, and storage resources

cloud compute typically comes with supporting services like auto scaling and load balancing that provide scalability and high performance

C - Network
users get access to networking resources on the cloud through virtualization or programatically, through APIs

D - Storage
3 types of cloud data storage: object, file, and block storage

object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient

# IaaS Use Cases

- enable their teams to set up test and development environments faster

- IaaS makes applications and data accessible as usual during a disaster or outage

- using cloud infrastructure for faster deployments and scaling infrastructure up and down as demand fluctuates

- high performance computing to solve complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations

- big data analysis
  Patterns, trends, and associations requires a huge amount of processing power

  cloud Infrastructure provides the required high-performance computing and also makes it economically viable

# PaaS - platform as a service

- a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a 3rd party

the PaaS providers host and manage everything at their data centers including:

- servers
- networks
- storage
- operating system
- application runtimes
- APIs
- middleware
- databases

* The provider also takes care of the installation, configuration, and operator of the application infrastructure, leaving the user only responsible for the application code and maintenance

* paid for on a usage basis and resources are purchased on-demand

with Iaas, the cloud provider offers access to 'raw' computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking

VS

PaaS, the cloud service provider delivers and manages the entire platform infrastructure, abstracting users from the lower level details of the environment

# essential characteristics of PaaS:

- high level of abstraction provided to users,

eliminating the complexity of deploying applications

- provide support services and APIs that help simplify the job of developers

- run-time environments; executes code according to applilcation owner and cloud provider policies

- rapid deployment mechanisms - deploy, run, and scale applications efficiently

- middleware capabilities - support a range of application infrastructure capabilities

# Most important use case for PaaS is strategic - build, test, deploy, enhance, and scale applications rapidly and cost effevtively

More Use Cases:

- api development and management

- internet of things (IoT) -

- business analytics/intelligence

- business process management (BPM)

- Master data management (MDM)

# Advantages of PaaS

- scalability - made possible because of the rapid allocation and deallocation of resources with pay as you go model

- faster time to market - APIs, support sevices, and middleware provided allows developers to focus their efforts on app development and testing

- greater agility and innovation - can experiement with multiple languages, OS's, and tool without having to invest in the resources

# Key PaaS offerings in todays market

  - buy and deploy apps in minutes

# Use Cases

- organizations are moving to SaaS to:

* reduce on premises IT infrastructure and capital expenditure
* avoid ongoing upgrades, maintenance and patching
* run applications with minimal input
* manage websites, marketing, sales and operations
* gain resilience and business continuity of the cloud provider

-> trending toward SaaS integration platforms

# Concerns

- data ownership and data safety
- third party maintains business critical data
- needs a good internet connection

# Summary

- 3 main service models available on the cloud -
  _ IaaS - infrastructure as a service
  _ PaaS - platform as a service \* SaaS - software as a service

- IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on demand

- PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a 3rd party

- SaaS provides access to a service providers cloud-based software. users simply access the applications on cloud while the cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application

# Public Cloud deployment model

- deployment models indicate
  - where the infrastructre resides
  - who owns and manages it
  - how cloud resources and services are made available to users

in a public cloud model, users get access to:

- servers
- storage
- network
- security
- applications as services delivered by cloud service providers over the internet

* using web consoles and API, users can provision the reources and services they need

* the cloud provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the infrastructure, renting it out to customers for a charge or usage-based fee

* users don't own the servers their apps run on or storage their data consumes, or manage the operations of the servers

offer significant cost savings, but the user doesnt have any control over the computing environment

# public cloud providers in the market today include:

- AWS
- Azure
- IBM Cloud
- Google Cloud
- Alibaba Cloud

all providers offer a core set of servies such as servers, storage, network, security, and databases
and they also offer a wide spectrum of niche servies with different payment options

# Public Cloud Characteristics

- virtualized multi-tenant architecture enabling tenants or users to share computing resources

- the cloud providers pool of resources, including platforms, infrastructure, and software are not dedicated for use by a single tenant or organization

# Public Cloud Benefits

- on-demand resources - allowing applications to respond to fluctuations on demand

- economies of scale -

- highly reliable - if one physical component fails, the service still runs unaffected on remaining components

# public cloud concerns

- security
  data breaches, data loss, account hijacking, insufficient due diligence, and system and app vulnerability

- data sovereignty compliance - regulations governing the storage, transfer and security of data

# Common Use Cases

- 1. building and testing applications, and reducing time to market for their prodcuts and services

- 2. businesses with fluctuating capacity and resourcing needs

- 3. building secondary infrastructures for disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity

- 4. cloud storage data management services for greater accessibility, easy distribution, and backing up their data

- 5. IT departments are outsourcing the management of less critical and standarized business platforms and applications to public cloud providers

# Private Cloud

NIST defines private cloud as infrastructre provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprised of multiple cosumers, such as the business units within the organization.

it may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combo of them, and may exist off premises

- can be implemented interally or externally

* internal infrastructure; on premises; owned and managed by organization

* external infrastructure - owned, anaged, and operated by service provider

# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- an external cloud that offers a private, secure, computing environment in a shared public cloud

can leverage benefits of a public cloud but still have access to a tailored cloud environment

- best of both worlds
  benefits:

  - dynamic scalability
  - cost efficiency
  - self-service

  but still have control over:

  - access
  - security
  - compliance

# Benefits of Private Clouds

- controlled by internal IT
- reduced costs - can use existing hardware and softwware
- better scalability
- controlled access and security
- greater agility

# Common Use Cases

- unique competitive advantage
- highly sensitive data and subject to strict regulations

- modernize and unify in-house and legacy applications

- integrate data and application servies from existing applications

- ability to build applcations anywhere and move them anywhere

- benefits of cloud computing while exercising full control over security and compliance issues

# Hybrid Cloud Model

connects an organizations on premise private cloud and third party public cloud

gives organization the flexibility, workloads move freely, and choice of security and regulation features

can leverage both public and private clouds for the same workload.
e.g. leverage additional public cloud capacity to accommodate a spike in demand for a private cloud application (known as cloud bursting)

# 3 Tenets

1.  interoperable - public and private clouds understand each others APIs, configureation, data formats, authentication, and authorization

2.  scalable - private clouds can leverage public cloud capacity

3.  portable - move applications and data between on-premise, cloud systems, and cloud service providers

# Types of Hybrid Clouds

- Hybrid monocloud
  one cloud provider

- hybrid multicloud
  can be deployed on any public cloud infrastructure

  - composite multicloud - greater flexibility

  # Benefits

  - security and compliance
    organization can deploy highly regulated or sensitive workloads in a private cloud while running the less sensitive workloads on a public cloud

  - scalability and resilience
    hybrid cloud allows you to scale up quickly, inexpensively, and even automatically using the public cloud infrastructure, all without impacting the other workloads running on the private cloud

  - resource optimization

  - cost-saving
    not locked in with specific vendor and don't have to make either-or decisions between the cloud models, you can make the most cost-efficient use of your budget.

# Use Cases

- sofware as a service integration

- data and AI integration

- enhancing legacy apps

- VMware migration - shifting on premises to virtual clouds

# Summary

- 3 deployment models

  - public
  - private
  - hybrid

  models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns, who manages it and how cloud resources and services are made available to users

  - public cloud - services provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage. users access virtualized compute, networking and storage resources as services

  - private cloud - provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by single organization. can be internal to the organiation and run on premises. or can be on a public cloud, as in the case of VPC - vritual private clouds and be owned, managed, and oeprated by the cloud provider

- hybrid cloud model - an organization on premises private cloud and third party public cloud is connected as a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging the features and benefits of both public and private clouds

# Overview of Cloud Infrastructure

- infrastructure layer
  consists of physical resources housed in regions, zones and data centers typically distributed around the world

* cloud region
  geographic area or location where a cloud provider's infrastructure is clustered, and may have names like NA south or US east

  - isolated from each other so that if one went down, the cloud operations in other regions would keep running

* Availability Zone
  each region can have multiple zones (AZ for short) which are distinct data centers with their own power, cooling, and networking resources

  - isolation of zones improves the clouds fault tolerance, decreases latency, and avoids a single shared point of failure

  - very high bandwidth connectivity with other AZs, data centers and the internet

* cloud data center - huge room or warehouse containing cloud infrastructure

  - contain pods and racks of computing resources such as servers, and storage and networking equipment

# Computing Resources

- cloud providers offer serveral compute options - virtual servers, bare metal servers, and 'serverless'

* VMs
  most of the servers run hypervisors to create virtual servers or virtual machines (VMs) - software based computers

* Bare metal servers

  - physical servers that aren't virtualized

* customers can provision VMs and Bare metal servers as needed and run their workloads on them

* Serverless
  - an abstraction layers on top of virtual machines

# Storage

- Default storage in local drives

  - Bare metal servers and virtual servers are provisioned with default storage in local drives

  - this storage can be provisioned and decommisioned by customers on demand so info can be lost when you delete or decommision a cloud servers

- additional storage options include block storage and file storage and object storage

  - block and file storge -
    used in traditional data centers but struggle with scale, performance and distributed characteristics of cloud

  - object storage -
    most common mode of storage in the cloud because its highly distributed and resilient

# Networking

- networking infrastructure includes hardware like :
  - routers
  - switches
- and for users in the cloud, the cloud providers have:

* SDN - software defined networking

  - certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programatically, through APIs

  - allows for easier network provisioning, configuration and management in the cloud

When servers are provisioned, you need to setup up public and private interfaces

- public interfaces

  - connect the servers to the public internet

- private interface

  - provide connectivity to your other cloud resources and help keep them secure

- network interfaces in the cloud need to have IP addresses and subnets either assigned automatically or configured

- in a cloud environment, its important to configure which network traffic and users can access your resources, which is done by setting up Security Groups and Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- most cloud providers provide

* Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs),
* Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and
* Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

* Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) -
  - distribute content to multiple points throughout the word so users accessing the content can access it more quickly by getting it from apoint nearest to them

# Virtualization and VMs explained

- Virtualization is the process of creating software-based, or virtual versions of compute, storage, networking, servers or applications

* hypervisor is what makes virtualization possible

- hypervisor - a piece of software that runs above the physical server, or host

- a hypervisor pulls the resources from the physical server and allocates them to the virtual environments

* 2 types of hypervisors

  - Type 1

  * installed directly on top of the physical server

  * also called bare metal servers

  * most frequently used because most secure, lower the latency

  * e.g. VMware, ESXi, or microsoft hyper-v

  - Type 2

    - a layer of host OS sits between the physical server and the hypervisor

    - often called 'hosted'

    - less frequently used and often used for end-user virtualization

    - e.g. oracle, virtualbox, vmware workstation

    - higher latency

# what is a VM?

- a software based computer that runs like a physical computer

  - has an OS and applications and is completely independent of one another

  - can run multiple VMs on a hypervisor and the hypervisor manages the resources that are allocated to these virtual environments from the physical server

  - extremely portable, can move a VM from one hypervisor to another almost instantly so this gives a lot of flexibility

  # Key benefits

  - 1. cost savings -
       - can run multiple virtual environments from one piece of infrastructure
       - consolidation; don't have to maintain as many servers, save on electricity and maintenance costs

- 2. Agility and speed -

- 3. lowers your downtime

  - host goes out unexpectedly; can easily move VMs from one hypervisor to another
    '

# Types of Virtual Machines

- Shared or Public Cloud VMs

* provider-managed

* multitenant

  - means underlying physical server is virtualized and shared across other tenants

* provisioned on demand with predefined sizes

  - different sizes and configurations ranging from a single virtual core/ small amount of RAM to multiple virtual cores and large amounts of RAM

* Transient or Spot VMs.

- take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center;

- lower cost, but can be de-provisioned at any time by the provider so best to use them for non-production workloads such as testing and developing applications

* Reserved capacity

  - reserve the capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments

# Dedicated Hosts

- Single tenant isolation

  - only your VMs run on a given host so they can make exclusive use of resources and use full capacity

- typically used for meeting compliance and regulatory requirement for licensing terms

# Bare Metal Servers

- single tenant dedicated physical server

- cloud provider manages the server up to the OS meaning if anything goes wrong with teh hardware or rack connection, they fix it and reboot the server

- customer is responsible for managing everything else on the server

# Bare Metal Configuration

- preconfigured by the cloud provider OR

- custom configured as per customer specifications

this includes:

- processors
- RAM
- hard drives
- specialized componenets
- the OS

- customers can also intall their own OS and can install hypervisors and create their own VMs and farms

- can also add GPUs
  - designed to accelerate scientific computation, data analytics, and rendering professional grade graphics

* take longer to provision than VMs because they are physical machines

* more costly

* dedicated for use by a single client; tend to be more expensive

* intended for long term, high performance in highly secure and isolate environments

* clients have full access and control of bare metal servers because no hypervisor is required because no sharing of underlying server hardware with other customers

* excel in big data analytics applications and GPU intensive solutions

# Example Workloads

HPC - high performance computing

ERP CRM AI deep learning and virtualization

# Bare Metal Servers vs Virtual Servers

- customer need -

  - Bare Metal
    work best for CPU and I/O intesive workloads

    excel with hightest performance and security

    satisfy strict compliance requirements

    offer complete flexibility, control and transparency

    come with added management and operational overhead

  - virtual servers
    rapidly provisioned

    provide and elastic and scalable environment '

    low cost to use

    limited in throughput and performance

    # Secure Networking in Cloud

# Containers

- an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, so it can be run anywhere whether it be on desktop, traditional IT or the cloud

- containers are small fast and portable and unlike VMs do no need to include a guest OS in every instance because they leverage host OS

Example:

# Summary

- cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and compute resources

- virtualization

  - process of creating software based version of physical resources, made possible through the use of hypervisors

- a few different types of Virtual Machines can be provisioned on the cloud

  - shared or public cloud VMs that are provider-managed multi tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes

  - transient or spot VMs that take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center

  - reserved VMs that allow you to reserve capacity and guaruntee resources for future deployments

  - dedicated hosts that offer single tenant isolation

  * bare metal servers

    - single tenant physical servers dedicated to a single customer.
    - fulfill the demanding needs of high performance computing (HPC) and data intense applications are ideal for applications that have high degree of security or compliance requirements

    * networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a serve rather than in the form of rack and mounted devices

    * Cloud resources such as VMs(or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Cloud (VPCs)

    * using private and public subnets allows users to deploy multi-tier enterprise applications securely

    * load balancers distribute teh traffic and allow applications to be responsive

    * containers are an executable unit of software in which applilcation code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere - desktops, traditional IT, or the cloud

    * containers are lighter weight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines - helping establish the development and deployment of cloud native applications

# Cloud Storage

where you save data and files in the cloud

cloud providers host, secure, manage, and maintain the cloud storage and associated infratstructure

# available in 4 main types 

* direct attached
  - sometimes referred to as 'local storage' is storage which is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack 

  - storage is fast and normally only used to store a servers OS

  negatives of direct attached for uses other than OS:

  - it's 'ephemeral' meaning it only lasts as long as the compute resource its attached to - it cannot be shared with other nodes

  - not as resilient to failure as other types of storage
  
* file storage

* block storage

* object storage
